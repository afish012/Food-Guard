Minimum Viable Product 1.
	What does it do: The app scans barcodes and is able to detect it correctly.
	What is going wrong: Although the app is intercating correctly with the API. There is no mechanism in place at the moment, to make the traffic light system work.
	We also don't have a local database to store everything that's being scanned.
